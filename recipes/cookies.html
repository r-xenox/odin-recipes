                <li>1 large egg</li>

                <li>½ tsp bicarbonate of soda</li>
                <li>¼ tsp salt</li>
                <li>200g plain chocolate chips or chunks</li>

            </ul>
        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oven to 190C/fan170C/gas 5 and line 
                two baking sheets with non-stick baking paper.</li>
            <li>Put 150g softened salted butter, 80g light brown 
                muscovado sugar and 80g granulated sugar into a 
                bowl and beat until creamy.</li>
            <li>Beat in 2 tsp vanilla extract and 1 large egg.</li>
            <li>Sift 225g plain flour, ½ tsp bicarbonate of soda 
                and ¼ tsp salt into the bowl and mix it in with a 
                wooden spoon.</li>
            <li>Add 200g plain chocolate chips or chunks and stir well.</li>
            <li>Use a teaspoon to make small scoops of the mixture, 
                spacing them well apart on the baking trays. This 
                mixture should make about 30 cookies.</li>
            <li>Bake for 8-10 mins until they are light brown
                 on the edges and still slightly soft in the centre if you press them.</li>
            <li>Leave on the tray for a couple of mins to set 
                and then lift onto a cooling rack.</li>
        </ol>
