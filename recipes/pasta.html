        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 salmon fillets</li>
                <li>1 tbsp olive oil, plus 1 tsp if roasting</li>
                <li>175g penne</li>
                <li>2 shallots or 1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
                <li>1 garlic clove, crushed</li>
                <li>100ml white wine</li>
                <li>200ml double cream or crème fraîche</li>
                <li>¼ lemon, zested and juiced</li>
                <li>½ small bunch dill, finely chopped</li>

            </ul>
        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>TYou can either steam or roast the salmon, depending 
                if you want to turn the oven on or not. To roast, heat 
                the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6, place on a baking 
                tray, drizzle with oil and roast for 12 mins until 
                opaque and the flesh starts to flake when pressed. To 
                steam, place the fillets skin-side down in a steamer, 
                and steam over a pan of simmering water for 8-10 mins 
                until cooked.</li>
            <li>While the salmon is cooking, boil the pasta for 10 mins
                 until al dente, then drain, reserving 100ml of the 
                 pasta water.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil on a medium heat in a wide frying pan and 
                fry the shallot for 6 mins until softened, but not 
                turning golden. Add the garlic and fry for a minute 
                more until fragrant. Add the wine, bubble for a few 
                minutes until reduced by half, then add the cream and 
                season well. Bring to a very gentle simmer.</li>
            <li>Bring up to the boil, then simmer for 30 mins until 
                the sauce looks rich.</li>
            <li>Heat oven to 180C/fan/160C/gas 4 and lightly oil an 
                ovenproof dish (about 30 x 20cm).</li>
            <li>Flake the cooked salmon into big chunky pieces, leaving the 
                skin behind. Add to the sauce with the cooked pasta. Add 
                the lemon zest, a squeeze of the juice and most of the 
                dill. Add a splash of the pasta water to the sauce to 
                coat the pasta if you need to. Toss gently to keep 
                the salmon in big pieces. Check the seasoning, if using 
                double cream you may need a squeeze more lemon juice. 
                Grind over some black pepper and scatter over the 
                remaining dill. Serve with a green salad.</li>
